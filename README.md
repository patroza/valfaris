Convert interfaces and type definitions to Morphic and io-ts definitions.


## IDEAS

1. Ability to convert dynamic type definitions... ie, the ones generated from ReturnType<typeof someFunction>
   for now the way to work with them is to generate d.ts files for that project, and then converting the d.ts definitions!
